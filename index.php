					<h2>Mexx Metais</h2>
					<p>Mexx hired an excellent local photographer and he took some beautiful photos of the company's headquarters, so I decided to put them in evidence. I was responsible for both <strong>design</strong> and <strong>development</strong> of the website, which is fully <strong>responsive</strong>.</p>

					<h2>Stellatech</h2>
					<p>Stellatech works with a wide range of LED products, so they asked us to design a website that was fast and easy to use. I was responsible for most of the <strong>design</strong> and interactions bits, as well all <strong>front-end development</strong>. After the launch, the visitor's sessions doubled and the bounce rate significantly improved.</p>

					<h2>Grupo Neo</h2>
					<p>It was great fun <strong>designing and development</strong> Grupo Neo's <strong>responsive</strong> website. They've the coolest products and so I follow the same path to coolness when creating the website. On a side note, the <strong>low poly</strong> background changes everytime the user reloads the page. So cool!</p>
