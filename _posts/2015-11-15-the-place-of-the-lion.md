> “Much was possible to a man in solitude, but some things were possible only to a man in companionship, and of these the most important was balance. No mind was so good that it did not need another mind to counter and equal it, and to save it from conceit and bigotry and folly.”

I was reading a book titled “The Inklings” and I came upon this quote that got me thinking about solitude and companionship. I'd always value solitude; I think it gives birth to the original in us and bring us closer to our true selves. However, Williams makes an excellent point in his quote: good companionship is good for your mind.
