After much delay, I gave up my preconceptions against preprocessors (I'm like a rapper) and started to use [SASS](/blog/tag/sass). It's worth alone just for the nesting and compressed output features, but if you want to really squeeze the juice out of it, you'll use the `@extend` and `@mixin` features too.

I was a bit confused at the beginning – when should I use each? – and after [ducking](https://duckduckgo.com) around I stumbled across this article on the [differences and use cases between @extend and @mixin]({{ page.link }}).
