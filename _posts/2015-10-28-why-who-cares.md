In a world with more than 7 billion people, I think it's safe to say that we are enormously insignificant, and much of what we do doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme of things. That's rather new information, but still people don't generally lose any sleep over it.

In fact, they're quite right, we shoudn't. In the book *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*, Douglas Adams nicely put that, “If life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.”.

And that's where the internet is different: folks tend to compare themselves and their work with virtually everyone in this cat-infested place. And let me tell you, there's some badass folks here, we're no match. Mostly everything that we do can be made better, and probably some guy already has done it somewhere.

But that doesn't mean that you're bad at what you do, and if you really think about it, it's not a fair competition to begin with: you're comparing yourself with folks from all over the world. Folks that work at Apple, for Christ's sake! Imagine how shitty would be the guy making coffee in your local coffeeshop if he had to compare his coffee against all best coffees in the world. Pretty shitty, huh? Truth be told, almost everyone had – at some point – felt the same way in the internet.

You don't need to do something because is cool or because people will like it. Don't unfairly compare yourself to others, instead, be a sponge and try to learn what you can with them. Don't ask “why?”, [just do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0).

You have to do what you love, and if you're not enjoying it, well, you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. Be happy, fellow nerd, that's what matter the most in the end.
