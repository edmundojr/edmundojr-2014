So, I've decided to create this brand new blog under this brand new website, using a brand new blog system called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Cool uh? Don't know about that, but at least it's brand new!

Jokes aside, in the beginning of the process of rewriting the blog, I thought about import all my previous content from Tumblr, but it was just inspirational quotes and random links, nothing really useful or important.

As I'm always tinkering with HTML and CSS, this will be the place to share my experiments and ideas.

## Why Jekyll?

First of all, let me say that I really love(d) Tumblr. That said, they service was <del>kind of crappy</del> unreliable lately. Sometimes my blog would stay down for hours on end. Not cool, Tumblr.

So I found Jekyll, which is incredible basic: it scans a directory of posts written in MarkDown (or Textile) and translates them into HTML. It's so easy to implemented that I did in one day for this site.

## Why in English?

**Aren't you brazilian?** I knowâ€¦ I am! But in the last 7 months I've been living abroad, far away from that goddamn hot country. This blog will be my English __dojo__ (do you have this world, right?), and here I'll practice and learn the ways of English writing, like a ninja! Either way, I'm not a writer and I'm not keen to write even in Portuguese, but *with struggle comes improvement* (or something like that), so I'd decided that this is the best course of action.

By the way, if you find something wrong, please *do* correct me, I would very much appreciate.
