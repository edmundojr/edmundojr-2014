If you don't like TextEdit showing a file picker instead of a new blank file by default, just type the following line on Terminal:

```
defaults write -g NSShowAppCentricOpenPanelInsteadOfUntitledFile -bool false
```

That's it, now when you open TextEdit you can type right away! Another option would be to disable iCloud syncing documents and data system-wide. Just go to System Preferences Â» iCloud and uncheck the **Documents & Data** option.
